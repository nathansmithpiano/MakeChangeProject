#### Make Change Project

### Description
This is a program to calculate change for a purchase.
Prompts: amount of a purchase, amount tendered.
Output: how much change in terms of American currency

### Lessons Learned
Using doubles produces unpredictable accuracy issues without some sort of additional "fix".  It is necessary to use Math.round(), floor/ceiling functions, decimal point formatting, or converting to cents in order to use integers rather than floating point numbers.
For the purposes of this task, the latter solution is used.

### Technologies Used
Java
Eclipse
Atom
Github
Terminal
MacBook Pro Retina 2015

### What was fun?
Messing with all the currency String formatting, though a simpler solution seems surely possible.
